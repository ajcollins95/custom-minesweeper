# Minesweeper
I built a minesweeper clone in React. I based it off of the google minesweeper found by... googling 'minesweeper'. To play the game, use a left click to uncover a tile, and a right click to flag it as a mine. The game ends when only mined tiles are remaining on the field (win) or a mine is uncovered (lose). The lose state is indicated when the mines are visible above the tiles, and the win state is shown when the remaining tiles turn red.
